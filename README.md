# LeNet-5
LeNet is a common term for LeNet-5, a simple convolutional neural network..

LeNet is a convolutional neural network that Yann LeCun introduced in 1989. LeNet is a common term for LeNet-5, a simple convolutional neural network.

The LeNet-5 signifies CNNâ€™s emergence and outlines its core components. However, it was not popular at the time due to a lack of hardware, especially GPU (Graphics Process Unit, a specialised electronic circuit designed to change memory to accelerate the creation of images during a buffer intended for output to a show device) and alternative algorithms, like SVM, which could perform effects similar to or even better than those of the LeNet.
